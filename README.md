# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

This repository contains projects completed during my NLP course:  

## Project 01. **Statistical Analysis of Language Corpora**
This project analyzes English, Gujarati, and Marathi corpora to test key language laws: **Zipf’s Law**, **Mandelbrot’s Approximation**, and **Heaps’ Law**. It applies tokenization, frequency analysis, and curve fitting to evaluate how well these models capture word distributions, with performance measured using metrics like R², MSE, and RMSE.

In addition, the study examines **stopwords** by calculating their share among the most frequent words and estimates the **computational cost** of handling large-scale text through vocabulary-document incidence matrices. Results include log-log plots, fitted parameters, and comparative tables.

Overall, the project combines **linguistic insights** with **computational analysis**, highlighting cross-language differences and challenges in multilingual NLP.
